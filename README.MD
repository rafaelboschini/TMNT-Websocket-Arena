# TMNT - Websocket Arena

This project is a part of a study about WebSocket and Canvas.
That is an example of how you can work with real-time data of multiples clients and join that with canvas to create more dynamic and impressive apps. 

No data is saved in the server, all data stay in server memory and all data erased when the server restarting.

This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), you can check a live demo [here](https://tmnt-chat.herokuapp.com/). 👈
